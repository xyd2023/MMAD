## Introduction
This repository contains source code for MMAD implemented with PyTorch. MMAD is a unified model for multi-class anomaly detection tasks based on state-space models. With the proposed Dilated Mamba Fuser, MMAD stands out as a robust and identical-shortcut-resistant reconstruction model. Through the proposed Hybrid State Space (HSS) module, MMAD improves computational efficiency. In addition, it further reduces the computational workload and improves the spatial perception capability of the HSS module through group scanning and multiple scanning strategies. Extensive experiments on seven evaluation metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving SoTA performance.
